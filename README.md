# Caesar-Cipher
<p>
This is ROT13 Cipher App. It was nicknamed after Julius Caesar, 
who used ciphers to encrypt his private messages. 
A Cipher rotates each letter in a word by a number. 
ROT1 Cipher rotates by 1, as such every letter 'A' in a text 
message shows up as a 'B'. ROT13 encrypts messages by rotating the letters 13 times.
